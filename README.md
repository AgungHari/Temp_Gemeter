# Wheelchair Control System Using Invisible Steering Gesture Based on LSTM

ðŸš€This is an original project by I Putu Krisna Erlangga, but it has been modified to control a wheelchair.

This project is still under development. It involves controlling the wheelchair with an invisible steering wheel, using hand gestures as if steering. The approach utilizes an LSTM model to send output to the wheelchair, corresponding to the five available classes.

## ðŸš¶ Progress of this Project
The trained model still does not deliver optimal performance, have not yet found the best approach based on the collected data.

The following is a light test using a small random amount of validation data.

It is better to use a CNN-LSTM approach.
